-- We can then tailor our marketing efforts to each customer segment, based on their unique RFM values. 
-- For example, we could offer special promotions or discounts to the VIP group to encourage them to continue making purchases,
-- send personalized emails to the loyal group to thank them for their business and keep them engaged,
-- and offer introductory discounts to the potential group to encourage them to make their first purchase.
